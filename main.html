        <p>
            Inception is a mind-bending science fiction thriller about Dom Cobb, a skilled thief who steals secrets from deep within the subconscious during dreams. 
            Cobb is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased if he can successfully perform "inception"—planting an idea in someone's mind. 
            The story takes you on a visually stunning journey through multiple layers of dreams, blending action, drama, and psychological tension.
